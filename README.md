# CS2810 — Humanoid Robot Soccer

A reinforcement learning template for humanoid robot soccer (shooting + goalkeeping)
with the Unitree G1 on MuJoCo physics. Built on the
[unitree_rl_mjlab](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_rl_mjlab) framework. More instructions can be found [here](./doc/instruction/cs2810-proj.pdf).

## Overview

- **Task**: G1 humanoid shoots a stationary ball toward a goal (shooter) and intercepts incoming balls (goalkeeper)
- **Physics**: MuJoCo with fluid air-drag on the ball, 50 Hz control
- **Robot**: Unitree G1, 29-DoF PD position control
- **Template**: Simplified from [HumanoidSoccer](https://github.com/TeleHuman/HumanoidSoccer) and [Humanoid-Goalkeeper](https://github.com/InternRobotics/Humanoid-Goalkeeper) reference implementations

## Setup

See [doc/setup_en.md](doc/setup_en.md) for environment installation.

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# List all tasks
python scripts/list_envs.py

# --- Shooter ---

# Play (visualize with zero agent)
python scripts/play.py Unitree-G1-Shooter --agent zero --viewer native

# Eval shooter
python scripts/eval_naive_shooter.py --headless --num-trials 50
python scripts/eval_naive_shooter.py --headless --num-trials 50 --checkpoint <path>

# --- Goalkeeper ---

# Play (visualize with zero agent)
python scripts/play.py Unitree-G1-Goalkeeper --agent zero --viewer native

# Eval goalkeeper
python scripts/eval_naive_goalkeeper.py --headless --num-trials 50
python scripts/eval_naive_goalkeeper.py --headless --num-trials 50 --checkpoint <path>

# --- Compete (Phase 2: cross-evaluation) ---

# Student/client side: start policy servers (one per robot)
python phase2/api_server.py --checkpoint <shooter.pt> --port 8000 --task shooter
python phase2/api_server.py --checkpoint <goalkeeper.pt> --port 8001 --task goalkeeper

# See phase2/README_CLIENT.md for student API submission.
# See phase2/README_SERVER.md for tournament-server deployment.
```

## Evaluation

### Shooter

Scene: G1 near origin facing -y (motion-local coords, identical to training/play). Goal placed at (0, -5, 0) rotated 90° to face G1, ball placed dynamically by the command system. No `motion_origin_offset` / `motion_yaw_offset` transform — eval uses the exact same coordinate system as training and play mode.

**Metrics** (matching HumanoidSoccer §IV-B):
- **Success Rate** — fraction of episodes where ball crosses goal plane (y≤-5, |x|≤1.5m, z≤1.8m)
- **Kick Accuracy** — cosine similarity between ball velocity direction and ball→goal-center vector
- **Kick Speed** — ball speed when first > 1 m/s

### Goalkeeper

Scene: G1 at goal line (0, 0, 0.8), yaw=0 faces +x. Ball launched via 6-region parabolic trajectory model from +x (3-5m front) toward -x (behind). Goal at (-0.5, 0, 0) behind G1.

**Ball trajectory** (matching Humanoid-Goalkeeper §III-A):
- 6 landing regions: Right/Left × Mid/Up/Low
- Ball start: +x 3–5m in front, random y/z within region bounds
- Ball end: -x 0.1–0.6m behind robot, within sampled region
- Flight time: 0.6–1.0s
- Parabolic velocity: v_xy = Δxy / t, v_z = (Δz + ½gt²) / t

**Metrics**:
- **Block Rate** — fraction of episodes where the ball does NOT cross the goal plane
  (x ≤ -0.5, |y| ≤ 1.5 m, z ≤ 1.8 m) before timeout. The ``fell_over`` termination is
  disabled during eval so that the outcome is decided solely by whether the ball enters
  the goal, not by whether the goalkeeper falls.

### Compete (Cross-Evaluation)

Scene: two G1 robots in a shared MuJoCo simulation — shooter at (4, 0, 0.8) yaw=π
faces -x toward the goal, goalkeeper at (0, 0, 0.8) yaw=0 faces +x.  Goal at
(-0.5, 0, 0) behind the goalkeeper.  Ball at (3, 0, 0.1) in front of the shooter.
Episode length: 5 s.

``phase2/compete.py`` reads raw MuJoCo state (joint positions, root poses, ball pos/vel)
and sends the same raw-state dict to each team's policy server via REST API.
Teams compute their own observations from raw state — observation spaces are
fully decoupled.

**Win conditions** (mutually exclusive):
- **Shooter wins** — ball crosses the goal plane (x ≤ -0.5, |y| ≤ 1.5 m, z ≤ 1.8 m)
  at any point during the 5 s episode (trial ends immediately on goal).
- **Goalkeeper wins** — the episode times out (5 s) without the ball ever
  crossing the goal line.

Falling over does **not** terminate the episode — the shooter may get back up
and keep playing, and the goalkeeper is free to dive.  There is no speed-drop
block detection; the goalkeeper's only job is to keep the ball out of the net
until time expires.

**Metrics**:
- **Shooter win rate** — fraction of trials where the ball crosses the goal line
- **Goalkeeper win rate** — fraction of trials ending in timeout without a goal
- **Ball crossed goal line** — fraction of trials where ball_final_x ≤ -0.5
  (sanity check; should equal shooter win rate)

## For CS2810 Students

This repository is a **simplified template** based on the reference implementations of [HumanoidSoccer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05310) and [Humanoid-Goalkeeper](https://github.com/InternRobotics/Humanoid-Goalkeeper).
It provides:

- **Playable environments**: `Unitree-G1-Shooter` and `Unitree-G1-Goalkeeper` with
  configurable scene layout, ball physics, and MuJoCo visualization.
- **Eval scripts**: `eval_naive_shooter.py` and `eval_naive_goalkeeper.py` that load
  checkpoints, run headless batch trials, collect paper metrics, and record videos.
- **Reference training configs**: The `config/training/` directory contains the
  complete training environment designs (observations, rewards, terminations,
  domain randomization) from both papers. These are provided as design reference
  only — they are **not registered as tasks**.

**You need to implement training yourself.** (*Jinxi's Note: actually you cannot get full 60% credit by just running the defined configs in this template, you need to understand the design and implement your own training pipeline.*)

> **Phase 2 Note**: The tournament uses a standardized REST API. Each team
> deploys their trained policy as a FastAPI server (`phase2/api_server.py`).
> `phase2/compete.py` runs the simulation locally, reads raw MuJoCo state, and sends
> it to each team's API. Teams compute their own observation tensors from raw
> state — observation spaces are fully decoupled. Customize the
> ``compute_obs()`` functions in `phase2/api_server.py` to match your training setup.
>
> Phase 2 docs are split by role:
> - Student/client API submission: `phase2/README_CLIENT.md`
> - Teaching-team tournament server: `phase2/README_SERVER.md`

## Contributing

This template is a work in progress. The training configs, environment wrappers,
and evaluation scripts may contain bugs or rough edges. **We encourage all
students to:**

- **Report issues** — if you find a bug, a broken config, or unclear
  documentation, open a GitHub Issue on the template repository.
- **Submit pull requests** — fixes, improvements, and additional utilities
  (e.g., better observation configs, visualization tools, or multi-agent
  helpers) are welcome. PRs that benefit the whole class will be merged and
  acknowledged.

Treat this repository as a living codebase that improves with your feedback.
