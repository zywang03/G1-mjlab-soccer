  Paper's 'eereach' — encourages hands and feet to reach toward the ball,

  exponential decay: sum_i exp(-||ee_i - ball||² / σ²).

  If ``planar`` is True, only the lateral/vertical (y, z) components of the
  offset are used (the forward x axis is ignored). This is important for the
  goalkeeper: the ball starts 3-5m in front, so a full 3D reach reward pulls the
  keeper into a forward lunge that topples it. Rewarding y-z alignment instead
  makes the keeper stay on its line (x≈0) and move a hand/foot to the ball's
  crossing point — the actual blocking behavior.

  If ``near_gate_x`` > 0, the reward is gated to fire only while the ball is
  within ``near_gate_x`` metres of the keeper plane (|ball_x_rel| < near_gate_x).
  Combined with full 3D distance (planar=False), this rewards an actual
  interception at the moment the ball arrives — it cannot be gamed by loose
  alignment, and being gated it does not pull the keeper into an early lunge at
  the far ball.
